### Hi there 👋 I'm Vincent (Yanchong) Xu

I'm an MSCS student at **NYU** who enjoys building reliable systems and turning real-world data into useful tools.  
I’m especially interested in **concurrency**, **high-performance computing**, and **production-ready backend/data systems**.

---

## 💫 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on  
  Systems + data projects involving concurrency control, scalable pipelines, and performance-focused implementations.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning  
  Lock-free/low-contention designs, GPU-accelerated data structures, and workflow reliability/observability patterns.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
  Open-source or research-oriented projects in:
  - concurrent / parallel programming
  - systems performance + reliability
  - data-intensive applications with strong engineering rigor

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with  
  Benchmarking best practices, performance profiling, and clean evaluation design for systems projects.

- 💬 Ask me about  
  Python/Java/TypeScript, backend architecture, concurrency patterns, OpenMP, or turning messy datasets into usable analytics.

- ⚡ Fun fact  
  I have **5 guinea pigs** 🐹🐹🐹🐹🐹
